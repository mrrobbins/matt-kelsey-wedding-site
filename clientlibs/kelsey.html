						<h5>The Bride</h5>
						<p>"Kelsey is everyone's friend," a close relative recently remarked. "Walking down the street, there's no one she wouldn't say hi to or be excited to meet." This is a wonderfully accurate observation of what it's ike to know Kelsey. Her kindness and loyalty to others sets her apart and this makes me luckier than a Powerball winner because she's choosen me to be her friend numero uno. &#8212 Matt</p>
						<br/>
						<p>Kelsey was born in Dayton, Ohio. She is the only child of Jim and Betsy Larsen. Kelsey is the only grandchild of Herb (Early) and Martha (Machie) Larsen and is one of 5 grandchildren of Dick & Bert Flitcraft. Kelsey lived in several places throughout her childhood including Beavercreek and Centerville, Ohio, Birmingham, England, and Ann Arbor, Michigan. Kelsey graduated from Centerville High School with 7 math credits in May of 2008.</p>
						<p>Kelsey attended (the) Ohio State University where she graduated cum laude in May 2013 with a major in Industrial and Systems Engineering and a minor in Developmental Studies. While attending university, Kelsey completed two short term study abroad programs in Turkey and Honduras. Kelsey traveled to Turkey with her scholars program: International Affairs. In March of 2009 Kelsey traveled with 50 other students to Istanbul, Bern, and Bergama. In March of 2010 Kelsey traveled to an orphanage in Honduras called Montana de Luz. It was here that she worked with a team of other engineering students to lower the ambient temperature of the different buildings in the orphanage 14 degrees by painting the roofing with a sustainable paint! It was also here that she fell through a roof, and toured a third world country hospital - but that's a story for another time. Kelsey was also heavily involved in Women in Engineering and the Institute of Industrial Engineers while in college.</p>
						<p>While in college, Kelsey held several different internships with JP Morgan Chase, Amazon.com, The Walt Disney Corporation, and Accenture. After college she accepted a position as a Digital Integration Consulting Analyst. Kelsey has consulted with two different companies doing various activities and is now a Data Consultant for a project at Cardinal Health. Kelsey has continued her involvement in the Institute of Industrial Engineers (IIE) and is currently serving on the board of Young Professionals. Kelsey has had the pleasure of attending four conferences with IIE in Orlando, Puerto Rico, Montreal, and Nashville. </p>
						<p>In her free time Kelsey enjoys planning future vacations, trying new restaurants with Matt, running at the gym, and quilting. She has enjoyed many wine and painting classes with different sets of friends over the years. She also really loves falling asleep on the couch while watching movies with Matt. </p>
