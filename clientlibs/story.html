						<p> Kelsey and Matt met in their AP Physics class their senior year of High School. Matt attended Kelsey’s graduation party and gave her a necklace in the shape of a heart which read “A true friend reaches for the hand but touches the heart”. On that day, June 1st, 2008, they began dating. Later that week Matt went to Tuscaloosa, Alabama for freshman orientation at University of Alabama. They spent the whole summer staying up late and looking at the stars at Ceasar’s Creek. They also loved enjoying milkshakes from Steak & Shake. For Kelsey’s birthday, Matt took Kelsey to La Comedia for a showing of Beauty and the Beast – it is a story that resonates with them, even today. </p>
						<p> Kelsey helped Matt move into his freshman dorm that fall and they said ‘Goodbye’ – but weren’t sure for how long. Kelsey visited for a week before she started school – they were trying to spend as much time together as possible while being 625 miles apart. </p>
						<p> That first summer after they started college, Matt and Kelsey both came home for the summer. They spent a lot of time together that summer – experiencing different stages in their relationship. For the fourth of July they went on their first family vacation with Kelsey’s parents to Washington D.C. Sadly, the summer came to a close much too quickly and they said ‘Goodbye’ again in August. </p>
						<p> Their sophomore year was spent with late night calls and morning wake up calls. Matt started working in Huntsville, Alabama which was 2 hours closer to Columbus! Kelsey and Matt were able to see each other a little more frequently since Matt wasn’t studying. Their junior year was very similar to their sophomore year, seeing each other occasionally, though, never enough. For spring break they were able to go to Amelia Island for a family vacation. </p>
						<p> The summer after their junior year, Kelsey was living in Bear, Delaware working for Amazon, and Matt came out for the fourth of July. They had such a blast on the east coast – spending a day in New York City, and a day in Philadelphia. Sadly, Matt had to go back to Huntsville all too soon. During their senior year they spent another year in phone calls – but that next summer, Kelsey took a traveling internship with Accenture and was able to fly between Huntsville, Alabama and Des Moines, Iowa every week! That was such a treat to be able to see each other every weekend. That fall, Kelsey took a job with Disney, and Matt was able to visit for Thanksgiving. They enjoyed Hollywood Studios, EPCOT, and Animal Kingdom – what an adventure! A month later, Matt graduated from University of Alabama and Kelsey was able to leave her internship a couple days early to see it! </p>
						<p> After graduation, Matt accepted a full-time position with JP Morgan Chase and moved to Columbus, Ohio! He got an apartment near work, and Kelsey visited him when she wasn’t studying or going to class. In May, Kelsey also graduated and moved in full time to Matt’s apartment. It was such a relief to be done with long distance! Kelsey and Matt traveled to many weddings that year in New York, and Alabama. Kelsey started with Accenture and went to Chicago for a month for training. Matt joined during a weekend and they had a grand time. </p>
						<p> 2014 included lots of adventures including a wedding in Auburn, Alabama (a hard city for Matt to visit), birthday getaway in Austin, Texas, a long weekend in Montreal, Canada, and visits to Michigan, Mississippi and Florida for Weddings and fun. One of Matt and Kelsey’s favorite things to do together is travel. 2015 brought more travel to Belize, Alabama, Utah, South Carolina and Puerto Rico. It was also the year they got engaged! Matt gave Kelsey a hot air balloon ride for her birthday. She was really excited because it was something she had never done before. When the day came Kelsey and Matt traveled to Marysville, Ohio to enjoy some food and drinks while waiting for the balloon launch. </p>
						<p> When it came time to get in the balloon, Matt and Kelsey were told they might have to ride in two separate balloons because of the weather - Matt alerted to the coordinator that this simply wouldn't do! It worked out, and Matt and Kelsey got assigned to the Soccer Balloon. The balloon was blown up and then Matt and Kelsey got into the balloon (there are no stairs, and the basket doesn’t have a door – it wasn’t graceful to say the least!). Then they went up into the sky. There wasn’t much wind, which gave the balloonist plenty of time to go up and down. The basket skimmed the top of the corn husks, and the tops of the trees. The balloonist even took them down and skimmed a pond! After some time, a voice came over the radio asking if we were ready to land – the balloonist said he wasn’t quite ready (he was in on the plan!). Matt hugged Kelsey and whispered in her ear the marriage proposal and she said “Yes”! She was so scared that the ring would fall – she didn’t want him to take it out of the box! He insisted, and put the ring on Kelsey’s finger – she clenched her fist in fear it would fall off! Matt shouted down below that they had just gotten engaged – his months of planning had paid off and Kelsey was so surprised! They landed, and a man came up – asking if they had just gotten engaged – apparently it was pretty obvious! They drove back to the landing strip and had some engagement pictures taken by a kind employee of the ballooning company. </p>
						<p> After the excitement died down a little, and they had called their families, Matt asked if Kelsey was ready to go – she was a little sad to go, but obliged. Matt suggested going for a drink and Kelsey thought that was a lovely idea – they drove to the Short North, a popular part of Columbus and Matt pulled up to a valet stand. Little did Kelsey know, Matt had rented out a hotel room at the top of the newest hotel in town. The valet came to take the bags and Kelsey was stunned! They went to their hotel room where there were chocolate covered strawberries and a bottle of wine waiting. It was the best day ever! </p>
						<p> The next morning, Kelsey and Matt enjoyed a brunch at The Pearl and slowly started to tell their friends the exciting news. </p>
						<p> Matt and Kelsey can’t wait to marry each other and are so excited to share the day with you! </p>
